			 After creating and reviewing the charts, the women in the olympic games curling section have a better gold to silver ratio in medals since 1998. Another observation is that the women have earned at least one of each medal while the men have earned some golds and silvers, but no bronzes. Lastly, both teams started competing in the olympics in 1998.
